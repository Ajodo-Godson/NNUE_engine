# NNUE_engine

### Gonna update this later. 
I was bored and decided to extend a previous project to using NNUE instead of base generic algorithms like MiniMax, alpha-beta pruning, Monte-Carlo and Quiescence search. 

However I intend for this NNUE to use Quiescence search, book-moving and a couple of other retrieval methods. 

We'll see how this goes....
